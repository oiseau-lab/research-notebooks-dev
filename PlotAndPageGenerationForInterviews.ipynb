    "The goal of this script is to extract a row from the `StakeholderDino_FRs.csv` spreadsheet, which relates to the functional requirements discussed as part of a single unstructured interview, and to represent the contents of that row pictorially. The true goal of which, is to allow interviewees to confirm whether we have truly captured their requirements in a less complicated manner than requiring them to wrap their heads around the master spreadsheet format.\n",

    "# Design\n",
    "To use DataMapPlot, a set of 2D coordinates (such as a 2D numpy array) and a list of labels, one for each coordinate pair is required. As we wish to make a map where the coordinates form a circle, we shall try to employ polar coordinates as part of a for loop. The number of positions that need generating relates to the number of top-level 'attributes' in the (not publicly accessible) [master spreadsheet](https://livemanchesterac.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/UOM-RIT-RLP/Shared%20Documents/New%20RLP/Open,%20Reproducible%20and%20Responsible%20Research/ORR12%20Digital%20Notebooks%20%26%20Sample%20Inventories/02%20Definition/Functional%20Requirements/Stakeholders_FRs_Bens.xlsm?d=w9d0e97af6a054764832f14b4d0730ed5&csf=1&web=1&e=N3aDly), as depicted in the innermost circle of [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLdds0oo=/?share_link_id=490665046930). These attributes are repurposed from [ELNFinder](https://eln-finder.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/home) and their [v1.0 Metadata Schema](https://doi.org/10.4126/FRL01-006452815). Hence, the most sustainable way to produce the plot requires reading in data from the spreadsheet."
